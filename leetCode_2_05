Question:
There is a function signFunc(x) that returns:

1 if x is positive.
-1 if x is negative.
0 if x is equal to 0.
You are given an integer array nums. Let product be the product of all values in the array nums.
Return signFunc(product).

code:
class Solution:
    def arraySign(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        m = 1
        for i in nums:
            m = m*i
        if m>0:
            return 1
        elif m<0:
            return -1
        elif m==0:
            return 0
